# MSP430 Project README

## Introduction

This README provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run files in conjunction with the MSP430 microcontroller. The project includes C code and assembly code for the MSP430G2553 microcontroller.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. MSP430 microcontroller development environment set up (e.g., MSP430-GCC, MSP430-GDB).
2. MSP430G2553 microcontroller hardware.
3. Connection to your MSP430 development board and power supply.

## File Descriptions

- `main.c`: This file contains the main C code for your MSP430 project.
- `assembly_code.s`: Assembly code that complements the C code.
- `libTimer.h` and `libTimer.c`: Library files for timer configuration.
- Other header files and libraries required for your specific project.

## Building and Flashing

Follow these steps to build and flash your project onto the MSP430 microcontroller:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Compile the C and assembly files using the following commands:

   ```bash
   msp430-elf-gcc -mmcu=msp430g2553 -o main.elf main.c assembly_code.s libTimer.c
   ```

   Replace `main.c`, `assembly_code.s`, and `libTimer.c` with the appropriate source files for your project.

3. Link the compiled code to create an executable file:

   ```bash
   msp430-elf-ld -o main.elf
   ```

4. Generate the binary file for flashing:

   ```bash
   msp430-elf-objcopy -O ihex main.elf main.hex
   ```

5. Connect your MSP430G2553 microcontroller to your development board and power supply.

6. Use your preferred flashing tool (e.g., MSP430 Flasher, MSP430 FET-Prog) to program the microcontroller with the generated `main.hex` file.

7. Verify that the program is successfully flashed onto the microcontroller.

## Running the Program

1. Ensure that the MSP430 microcontroller is properly connected to the development board and powered.

2. If required, configure any additional hardware connections as specified in your project.

3. Execute the program on the MSP430 by either:
   - Power-cycling the MSP430.
   - Resetting the MSP430 microcontroller.

4. Observe the program's behavior and output on the microcontroller's pins, LEDs, or other peripherals, as defined in your code.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or unexpected behavior, consult the following resources:

- MSP430 microcontroller datasheet and reference manual.
- MSP430 development environment documentation.
- Online forums and communities related to MSP430 development.
